## Fancy a pie with distinct colors?

This package 'colPal' is your friend then.
You can have as many as 28 distinct colors you can get.

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

Let's setup the environment for you.
```{r setup}
library(colPal)
```

We decide number of distinct colors we want first. The function provides a visual for the colors provided to you via a color pie, besides that the color codes (in hexx format) are also returned via the function.
```{r width = 6, height = 6}
color_code_list <- colPal::get_color_pie(number_of_colors = 10)
color_code_list
```
